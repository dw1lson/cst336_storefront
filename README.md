## Team Project Description

#### Create an online catalog / shopping cart.

Data should come from a database that uses at least three tables and include at least 40 records (across all tables)

### Users should be able to: 

1) Filter the data retrieved using at least three fields (e.g., filtering movies by category or director)
2) Sort the results using at least one field (asc,desc) 
3) Click on a result item to get further information
4) Add items to a shopping cart and display cart contents (you must use Session variables)
